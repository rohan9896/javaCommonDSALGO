TREES - NON linear data structure
                                                    NODE
                                                  / / | \ \.....\   <- pointers to n number of nodes
                Further divided into notes ->    / \
                                              leafs(which are not further divided into nodes(doesnt have any child))
                                              


BINARY TREE - 0 or 1 or 2 child nodes
Max. no of nodes in tree of height h is (2^(h+1))-1 or (2toThePower level-1) or (sum of gp till 2toThePower h)
Min. no of nodes in tree of height h is h+1
node contains two pointers- i) pointer to left subtree
                            ii) pointer to right sutree
types of binary tree - 
                      i) strict/proper binary tree - every node has exactly two or zero number of child
                      ii) full/perfect binary tree - every node should have rwo children and all leaf nodes should be at same level
                      iii) Complete binary tree - all levels (except possibly last) are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible.


Traversal -
